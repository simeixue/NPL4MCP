Rescaling can be used as a rough first-pass estimate. But for best results, \n    it would be better to start a new Chronulus forecasting use case predicting in levels from the start.\n    \nHow to use this tool:\n- To use this tool present prediction_id from the normalized prediction and the min and max as floats\n- If the user is also changing units, consider if the units will be inverted and set the inverse scale to True if needed.\n- When plotting the rescaled predictions, use a Rechart time series plot with the appropriate axes labeled and include the chronulus \n    prediction explanation as a caption below the plot. \n- If you would like to add additional notes about the scaled series, put these below the original prediction explanation. \n",
